# Project Rules for Travel Safety Companion

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE - READ FIRST ⚠️

### NEVER MAKE UP UI PATHS OR LOCATIONS
**THIS IS THE MOST COMMON AND FRUSTRATING MISTAKE. DO NOT DO THIS.**

- **NEVER** say "Go to Settings → X → Y" unless you have verified this exact path exists
- **NEVER** say "Check the logs in the dashboard under X → Y" unless you know this location exists
- **NEVER** reference menu items, tabs, buttons, or navigation paths you haven't verified
- **NEVER** guess where features are located in third-party tools (Vercel, Supabase, GitHub, etc.)
- **ALWAYS** say "I don't know where that is located" or "Can you tell me where you see that?" instead
- **ONLY** reference UI elements if you can verify them from official documentation or the user's description
- **IF** you're about to mention a path like "Go to X → Y", STOP and ask the user instead

**Examples of what NOT to say:**
- ❌ "Check the Vercel function logs (in the Vercel dashboard under the deployment → Functions tab)"
- ❌ "Go to Settings → General → Framework Preset"
- ❌ "Navigate to Project Settings → Environment Variables"

**Examples of what TO say:**
- ✅ "I don't know where the logs are in Vercel's dashboard. Can you check the logs and share any errors you see?"
- ✅ "I'm not sure where that setting is located. Can you tell me where you see it?"
- ✅ "Please check the Vercel dashboard for any error messages and let me know what you find."

## AI Assistant Behavior Guidelines

### Testing and Verification
- **ALWAYS test fixes thoroughly before claiming they are complete**
- **NEVER claim something is "fixed" without proper verification**
- **Always verify that changes actually work as intended**
- **Be humble and admit when you're not sure about results**
- **Do not let the process hang**

### Communication Style
- **Be careful about being overconfident**
- **Don't assume fixes work without testing them**
- **Ask for verification when unsure**
- **Be honest about limitations and uncertainties**
- **NEVER make up UI paths, menu locations, or navigation paths for websites/tools you haven't verified**
- If you don't know the exact location of a setting or feature, say so explicitly
- Don't guess or infer navigation paths (e.g., "Go to Settings → General → Framework Preset")
- Instead, ask the user to navigate or provide the actual path they see
- Only reference UI elements if you can verify them from documentation or the user's description

### Development Practices
- **Test all changes in the browser/application before declaring success**
- **Verify API endpoints are working correctly**
- **Check that UI changes render properly**
- **Ensure backend and frontend integration is functioning**

### Code Quality
- **Follow existing code patterns and conventions**
- **Maintain consistency with the current codebase structure**
- **Use proper error handling and validation**
- **Document complex logic and decisions**

## Remember
- **Test first, claim success second**
- **Verify everything works before moving on**
- **Be honest about what you can and cannot confirm**
- **NEVER make up UI paths or locations - this is the most frustrating mistake**

# Session History Logging

- At the end of every user-facing task, append a concise summary to `/notes.md`.
- If `/notes.md` does not exist, create it before writing the summary.
- Use the following template for each entry:
  - `Date: YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `Tasks:`
    - `...` (bullet list of what was completed)
  - `Follow-ups:`
    - `...` (bullet list of outstanding items or `None`)
- Separate entries with a blank line for readability.


# Test-First Development

- **ALWAYS create tests for new functionality before or alongside implementation.**
- **NEVER commit code until all tests are passing.**
- When adding new features:
  1. Write tests first (or alongside implementation)
  2. Implement the feature
  3. Run tests to ensure they pass
  4. Fix any failing tests
  5. Only then commit the changes
- Test coverage should include:
  - Unit tests for individual functions/components
  - Integration tests for API routes and workflows
  - Component tests for UI interactions
  - Edge cases and error handling
- If tests fail, fix them before committing. Do not commit broken tests.
